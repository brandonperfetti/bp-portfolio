# Auth, gating & email capture (Clerk)

## Setup

- `@clerk/nextjs`; middleware lives in `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 proxy
  convention), wrapped by `isClerkEnabled()` so missing keys never break
  boot. `<ClerkProvider>` mounts in the frontend layout under the same gate.
- Routes: `/sign-in`, `/sign-up` (catch-all Clerk components), `/account`.
- Header shows a signed-in-only `UserButton` chip (`HeaderUserButton`,
  mounted only when `isClerkEnabled()` — anonymous visitors and keys-off
  environments get the pre-auth header byte-identical). Sign-IN has no
  persistent header entry by design; gated-article CTAs are the door.
  "Manage account" navigates to `/account`, the one profile surface.
- Payload admin auth is **separate** (Payload Users) — Clerk never guards
  `/admin`.

## Gating model (server-side, §12)

- Posts carry `access.visibility = public | gated` plus dormant
  `requiredPlan` / `requiredFeature` fields (Clerk Billing seam).
- Enforcement happens in RSCs via `getViewer()` (`src/lib/auth/getViewer.ts`)
  - `canAccess(isAuthenticated, doc)` (`src/access/canAccess.ts`): gated
    bodies are excluded from the payload for anonymous viewers — a teaser +
    sign-in prompt renders instead. Client `<Protect>`-style components are
    UX only.
- `getViewer()` returns `{ isAuthenticated, userId }` (`userId` added #74). The
  Corvus chat route is the first consumer keying a rate limit by Clerk `userId`
  — anonymous visitors hit an IP-keyed free-taste gate + abuse limit, signed-in
  users a `userId`-keyed higher ceiling (see `docs/AI.md`).
- **Billing flip (do not build until asked):** enable Clerk Billing, replace
  the `canAccess` internals with plan/feature checks (`has({ plan })`), and
  the field seams light up. `// TODO(brandon): enable Clerk Billing` marks
  the seam.

## Email capture

- Two capture paths, one shared helper (`src/lib/email/captureContact.ts`
  — logs and swallows every failure; capture is never the caller's
  primary job):
  1. Clerk webhook → `POST /api/clerk/webhook` (svix signature verified
     with `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`) on sign-up.
  2. Contact form → explicit opt-in checkbox (unchecked by default) on
     the Messenger form; `/api/contact` captures only when the flag is
     set AND the message delivered. Never capture without that flag.
     Both land in the Resend contact list, segmented via
     `RESEND_CONTACT_SEGMENT_ID`. Respect the marketing consent field, and
     honor per-contact unsubscribe state before any broadcast ever sends.
     (Migrated from the SendGrid marketing list 2026-08-10 — SendGrid walls
     contact storage behind a separate paid Marketing Campaigns plan.)
- Payload transactional email (forgot-password etc.) rides the
  `@payloadcms/email-resend` adapter configured in `payload.config.ts`
  (active when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set).

## Contact hygiene: the Clerk↔Resend mapping (#86)

`POST /api/clerk/webhook` handles three events. Keeping a deleted user's
contact out of the audience, and following a primary-email change into it,
both need something neither event payload carries: a stable link from a Clerk
user to a Resend contact.

**Why a mapping is required rather than convenient.** Two measured facts:

- `user.deleted` carries only `{ deleted, id, object }` — there is **no email
  address in it**, so the contact cannot be looked up after the fact.
- A Resend contact has no external key, and its email is the URL selector.
  `contacts.update` PATCHes `/contacts/:emailOrId` with a body of only
  `unsubscribed`, `first_name`, `last_name` and `properties` (measured against
  the pinned `resend@6.18.1` dist), so **a contact's email cannot be renamed**.

So the link is stored before it is needed: at `user.created` the Resend contact
id is written to the Clerk user's `external_id` via the Backend API
(`clerkClient().users.updateUser`), and every later event resolves through it.

| Event          | Behavior                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user.created` | `captureContact`, then write the contact id to `external_id`. Skipped when `external_id` is already set; a failed write logs and still acks. |
| `user.deleted` | Remove the contact by id. No `external_id` → 2xx no-op with a distinct log line.                                                             |
| `user.updated` | If the primary email changed, create the new contact, then remove the old, then write the new id back to `external_id`.                      |

Primary email is always resolved via `primary_email_address_id`, never
`email_addresses[0]`. The two coincide at sign-up but diverge on exactly the
multi-address accounts `user.updated` exists to follow.

**Delete, not suppress.** A Resend _suppression_ blocks all mail to an address
— including transactional mail such as a password reset. That makes it the
wrong tool for "this account is gone": if the person signs up again they are
silently unreachable. Audience removal is marketing-scoped and reversible, so
`user.deleted` deletes the contact. Suppression is not used anywhere in this
codebase.

**Ordering on an email change is the safety argument.** Because the SDK cannot
rename a contact, the change is create-new-then-remove-old, in that order. If
the create fails, the old contact is still in the audience and `external_id`
still points at it — the run is a no-op rather than a data loss. Redelivery is
safe: the second delivery reads the already-updated contact, sees the addresses
match, and stops before touching anything.

### Backfill

`scripts/backfill-clerk-resend-mapping.ts` gives pre-#86 users the mapping the
webhook now writes at sign-up, matching each user's primary email to an
existing Resend contact.

```bash
payload run scripts/backfill-clerk-resend-mapping.ts           # dry run
payload run scripts/backfill-clerk-resend-mapping.ts --apply   # write
```

**Dry run by default** — it prints a per-user plan and writes nothing without
`--apply`. It has no destructive mode: it never deletes a contact, never clears
an `external_id`, and never overwrites a mapping the webhook already made. The
rules (`scripts/lib/clerk-resend-mapping.mjs`) skip rather than guess whenever
a user has no primary email, no matching contact, an address two contacts
share, or a contact another Clerk user already claims — that last one because
two users pointed at one contact means the first `user.deleted` removes
somebody else's contact. Re-running is safe; a mapped user is `already-mapped`
next time. Needs `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` and `RESEND_API_KEY`.

### Operational order (Brandon, Clerk dashboard)

The production endpoint must be subscribed to `user.deleted` / `user.updated`
**only after this ships** — subscribing first means deliveries against a
handler that ignores them. Dev is already subscribed and no-ops harmlessly.

1. Deploy the webhook change.
2. Run the backfill dry run, read the plan, then re-run with `--apply`.
3. In the Clerk dashboard, add `user.deleted` and `user.updated` to the
   **production** endpoint's subscribed events.
4. Send a dashboard test delivery for each and confirm the log lines.

Note for step 4: a dashboard test delivery carries no `external_id`, so the
expected result is the distinct no-op log line, not a Resend call.
