# Auth, gating & email capture (Clerk)

## Setup

- `@clerk/nextjs`; middleware lives in `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 proxy
  convention), wrapped by `isClerkEnabled()` so missing keys never break
  boot. `<ClerkProvider>` mounts in the frontend layout under the same gate.
- Routes: `/sign-in`, `/sign-up` (catch-all Clerk components), `/account`.
- Header shows a signed-in-only `UserButton` chip (`HeaderUserButton`,
  mounted only when `isClerkEnabled()` — anonymous visitors and keys-off
  environments get the pre-auth header byte-identical). Sign-IN has no
  persistent header entry by design; gated-article CTAs are the door.
  "Manage account" navigates to `/account`, the one profile surface.
- Payload admin auth is **separate** (Payload Users) — Clerk never guards
  `/admin`.

## Gating model (server-side, §12)

- Posts carry `access.visibility = public | gated` plus dormant
  `requiredPlan` / `requiredFeature` fields (Clerk Billing seam).
- Enforcement happens in RSCs via `getViewer()` (`src/lib/auth/getViewer.ts`)
  - `canAccess(isAuthenticated, doc)` (`src/access/canAccess.ts`): gated
    bodies are excluded from the payload for anonymous viewers — a teaser +
    sign-in prompt renders instead. Client `<Protect>`-style components are
    UX only.
- `getViewer()` returns `{ isAuthenticated, userId }` (`userId` added #74). The
  Corvus chat route is the first consumer keying a rate limit by Clerk `userId`
  — anonymous visitors hit an IP-keyed free-taste gate + abuse limit, signed-in
  users a `userId`-keyed higher ceiling (see `docs/AI.md`).
- **Billing flip (do not build until asked):** enable Clerk Billing, replace
  the `canAccess` internals with plan/feature checks (`has({ plan })`), and
  the field seams light up. `// TODO(brandon): enable Clerk Billing` marks
  the seam.

## Email capture

- Two capture paths, one shared helper (`src/lib/email/captureContact.ts`
  — logs and swallows every failure; capture is never the caller's
  primary job):
  1. Clerk webhook → `POST /api/clerk/webhook` (svix signature verified
     with `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`) on sign-up.
  2. Contact form → explicit opt-in checkbox (unchecked by default) on
     the Messenger form; `/api/contact` captures only when the flag is
     set AND the message delivered. Never capture without that flag.
     Both land in the Resend contact list, segmented via
     `RESEND_CONTACT_SEGMENT_ID`. Respect the marketing consent field, and
     honor per-contact unsubscribe state before any broadcast ever sends.
     (Migrated from the SendGrid marketing list 2026-08-10 — SendGrid walls
     contact storage behind a separate paid Marketing Campaigns plan.)
- Payload transactional email (forgot-password etc.) rides the
  `@payloadcms/email-resend` adapter configured in `payload.config.ts`
  (active when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set).
